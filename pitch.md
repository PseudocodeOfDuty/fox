### Strategy

<a id="riddles"></a>

### Riddles
### problem solving
#### easy
- algorithm
    - count frequency --> use map as storing data structure cause o(1) retrieve
    - heapsort --> fast and easy to get max from it

- use cases
    - Natural Language Processing (NLP):
        - Text summarization: Identifying the most frequent words in a document can help in summarizing its content.
        - Sentiment analysis: Analyzing the frequency of certain words can help determine the sentiment of a piece of text.
        - Language modeling: Understanding the distribution of words in a corpus is essential for building accurate language models.

    - Search Engine Optimization (SEO):
        - Keyword analysis: Identifying frequently used keywords in web content helps in optimizing search engine rankings.
        - Content optimization: Analyzing top frequent words in competitors' content can inform content creation strategies.

    - Text Classification:
        - Spam filtering: Analyzing the frequency of certain words in emails or messages can aid in detecting spam.

#### medium
- algorithm
    - uses a stack (monotonic) to decode the string. 
- use cases
    - Image Compression: In image processing, RLE can be used to compress bitmap images. For example, in black and white images where consecutive pixels have the same color, RLE can represent these runs of pixels with a count and the color value, reducing the size of the image data.

    - Text Compression: RLE can be applied to compress text files, especially those containing long sequences of repeated characters or symbols. For example, in DNA sequencing where long sequences of the same nucleotide base are common, RLE can significantly reduce the size of the data.

    - Storage Optimization: RLE can be used for data storage optimization. For example, in databases where there are repetitive patterns or sequences, RLE can be applied to reduce the storage space required.

#### hard
- algorithm
    - Dynamic programming --> to count the unique paths to the right bottom corner from each cell

- use cases
    - Robotics and Navigation:
Imagine a robot located at the top-left corner of a grid representing a floor plan. The robot needs to reach the bottom-right corner, and it can only move right or down. The number of unique paths represents the different ways the robot can navigate through the space without colliding with obstacles.

    - Network Routing:
In networking, this problem can be analogous to finding the number of different paths for data to travel from the source to the destination. Each grid point could represent a router or a network node, and the paths represent the various routes data can take.

### security

<a id="sec_medium"></a>

##### medium --> decode steganography
- algorithm
    - call the dell stenography function
- use cases
    - Covert Communication: Steganography can be used for covert communication in various scenarios where privacy and secrecy are crucial. For instance, it could be used by intelligence agencies or military personnel to transmit sensitive information without attracting attention. In the digital realm, steganography can be employed to hide messages within seemingly innocuous images, audio files, or even text.

    - Digital Watermarking: In the realm of copyright protection and intellectual property rights, steganography finds application in digital watermarking. Watermarks can be embedded within images, audio, or video files to assert ownership and deter unauthorized use or distribution.

    - Information Concealment in Malware: Malicious actors often use steganography to hide malicious code or instructions within seemingly innocuous files. This technique can be employed in malware to evade detection by antivirus software or to facilitate covert communication between malware components and command-and-control servers.

<a id="sec_hard"></a>

##### **hard --> DES**
- algorithm
    - implement DES from scratch 
- use cases
    - **Legacy Systems:** Some older systems may still rely on DES for encryption due to historical reasons or compatibility constraints. While not recommended for new deployments, existing systems may continue to use DES until they can be upgraded.

    - **Low-Security Applications:** In scenarios where the data being encrypted doesn't require high levels of security, DES may still be considered sufficient. For example, in certain internal communications within organizations where the risk of a sophisticated attack is low.

### Machine learning

    - **Law Enforcement and Security:** Deploy the model in security systems to analyze voiceprints captured from surveillance recordings or communication channels for identifying suspicious activities or persons of interest.

    - **Research and Analysis:** Utilize the model for research purposes, such as analyzing large datasets of voiceprints to identify trends, patterns, or anomalies related to speech patterns or voice characteristics.

    - **Education and Training:** Integrate the model into educational platforms for teaching and training purposes, such as providing feedback on pronunciation or helping individuals improve their speech recognition skills.

- possible improvements:
    Data Collection and Preparation: Gather a large dataset of voice fingerprints containing recordings with the specified words ("dell" for real, "fooled" for fake) and noise for empty. Ensure that the dataset is diverse and representative of the types of voiceprints you expect to encounter.

    Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected data to convert it into the appropriate format for input to your CNN model. This may involve converting audio recordings into spectrograms or other feature representations that can be represented as 3D NumPy arrays.

    Model Training: Train your CNN model on the prepared dataset. Use techniques such as data augmentation and regularization to improve generalization performance. Optimize hyperparameters and monitor the training process to ensure convergence and prevent overfitting.

    Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate validation set to assess its performance. Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure classification performance across the different classes (real, fake, empty).

    Deployment: Once you're satisfied with the performance of your model, deploy it for inference on a larger scale. This could involve integrating the model into a larger system or application where it can process voiceprints in real-time or in batch mode.

    Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the performance of your deployed model and collect feedback to identify areas for improvement. Retrain the model periodically with new data to adapt to changes in the input distribution or to improve performance over time.

    Scaling Infrastructure: If necessary, scale the infrastructure supporting your model to handle increased load or throughput as usage grows. This may involve deploying the model on distributed systems or using cloud-based services for scalability and reliability.
